# Fluid-Communities

FluidCommunities is a novel community detection algorithm based on the simple idea of fluids interacting in an environment, expanding and contracting. It is programmed in Python and it works with Networkx graph objects [https://github.com/networkx/networkx]. Futur implementations will be developed in order to allow the usage of FluidCommunities with other graph-based Python libraries.
